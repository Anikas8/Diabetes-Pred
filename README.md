# Diabetes-Pred
## Diabetes Prediction System
This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on various health metrics such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more using machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM).

### Technologies
Python
Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Streamlit (for the UI, optional)
#### Features
Preprocesses data for training.
Uses machine learning to predict diabetes risk.
Real-time prediction with input health data.
Visualizes data and prediction results.
##### Dataset
Uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Database with features like glucose levels, age, BMI, and insulin to predict diabetes.
